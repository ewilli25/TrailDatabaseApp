TRAIL BOSS
This Swift app is designed for users to keep track of their own personal information and experiences on any trails they have completed from as many different parks as they want. When a trail is added to the list the user also chooses the park it is in as well as the location of the park. They are able to toggle how theyâ€™ve done the trail, hike, run, and/or bike. They are also able to rate the trail so they know if they would want to do it again/how they liked it. They will be able to leave a note/description about the trail which can include any information they like, such as how long it takes, is it a lot of uphill, if and where there is water. They are also able to save an URL with information about the trail. It is a way to bookmark the trails website or a website about the trail in a place that they will always know it will be rather than a random bookmark on their computer or other device. In addition to storing information on the trail the user is also able to upload photos from the trail. The app also has a compass that the user can use while on the trail. The app also has a map that tracks the user's location so they can see where they are on the trail.
